# TARDIS-Emulator
This is a Repo with my ongoing research in Emulators to expedite the TARDIS simmulation. Any code used will be linked here. 
## Papers
The paper in the directory is based on a proof of concept of how such an emulator could work and that it is possible for a Neural Network(NN) to predict the values that TARDIS is solving for.
