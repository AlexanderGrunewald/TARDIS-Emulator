# TARDIS-Emulator
This is a Repo with my ongoing research in Emulators to expedite the TARDIS simmulation. Any code used will be linked here. 
## Papers
The paper in the directory is based on a proof of concept of how such an emulator could work and that it is possible for a Neural Network(NN) to predict the values that TARDIS is solving for.

## Note:
The code in this repo in its organised state will not work as most of the directories and imports are hard coded. This will be fixed in its final release and when I have the time. The Data will be uploade to some repository eventually as well.
